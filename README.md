## How to run the server

We use docker for running our app/servers

1. Copy the sample env file `cp .env.sample .env`
2. Start docker locally and run `make start`
3. To run migrations, `make migrate`
4. To run Seed, `make seed`
5. To stop the docker process, `make stop`
6. Start the server `make start`
